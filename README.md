# Project Statement

To effectively overcome the problem of maintaining a proper data of society we propose the following solution:
A system that automates a variety of management activities for residential societies, apartment buildings, or community organizations.

# Project Aim
To improve and simplify a housing society's or community's administration and operation.

# Applications

Member administration: 
The system enables administration to keep track of society members' contact information, occupancy details, and car information in a centralised database. It aids in overseeing member transfers, registrations, and the tracking of their payments and dues.

Accounting and Billing: 
The system offers tools for managing finances, such as creating invoices, monitoring payments, controlling maintenance fees, and keeping track of financial data. It streamlines the billing process and makes sure all financial activities are transparent.

Amenities and facility booking: 
Residents may utilize the system to reserve community amenities like clubhouses, parking lots, etc. The system controls these amenities' availability, booking, and invoicing, assuring fair usage and effective use.
